# SAMPL

## How to display the html content in the browser

- Download the project folder as a zip file
- Decompress the folder and extract the files within it into your desktop
- Navigate into the **web_static** folder

There are two ways you can display the html on the browser
1st method is to directly click on it and it will be opened in you default browser(e.g, Safari)
2nd method requires you open the terminal and type the following command-lines.

```Bash
cd ~/Downloads/SAMPL/web_static
open <filename>
```
Note: choose the easiest method for you.

### Content inside **web_static**

Intpect the files in the browser or in your preferred text editor
#### files

- [x] Home page is *index.html*
- [x] About page is *about.html*
- [x] Register page is *register.html*
- [x] Login Page is *login.html*
#### folders

- [x] assets folder (I made this for CSS stylings after designing and prototyping the pages layout and style)

### Requirements

### First Task
First Task: Design Basic Page Structure

1. Design a header for all pages:
- Create a simple, clean header design
- Include the SAMPL logo (use DejaVu Serif as the font for the logo)
- Add the title "Learning music synthesis made simple" below the logo(you can experiment with both fonts in the requirements)
- Ensure the header is responsive and looks good on mobile devices
- Determine the ideal spacing between the logo and title
- Position them to the left of the header.

2. Design a footer for all pages:

- Create a minimalist footer design
- Include a copyright sign (Â©) with the current year
- Place a small SAMPL logo next to the copyright text
- Position the copyright and logo to the left side of the footer
- Ensure the footer stays at the bottom of the page, even with minimal content
- Make the footer responsive for various screen sizes.

3.Create variations:

- Design 2-3 variations of the header and footer for review
- Include a version with a light background and a version with a dark background


That's it for now, good luck and thanks!
